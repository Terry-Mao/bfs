# gosnowflake configuration file example

# Note on units: when memory size is needed, it is possible to specify
# it in the usual form of 1k 5GB 4M and so forth:
#
# 1kb => 1024 bytes
# 1mb => 1024*1024 bytes
# 1gb => 1024*1024*1024 bytes
#
# units are case insensitive so 1GB 1Gb 1gB are all the same.

# Note on units: when time duration is needed, it is possible to specify
# it in the usual form of 1s 5M 4h and so forth:
#
# 1s => 1000 * 1000 * 1000 nanoseconds
# 1m => 60 seconds
# 1h => 60 minutes
#
# units are case insensitive so 1h 1H are all the same.

# When running daemonized, gosnowflake writes a pid file in 
# /tmp/gosnowflake.pid by default. You can specify a custom pid file 
# location here.
pid /tmp/gosnowflake.pid

# Sets the maximum number of CPUs that can be executing simultaneously.
# This call will go away when the scheduler improves. By default the number of 
# logical CPUs is set.
# 
# maxproc 4

# By default gosnowflake listens for connections from all the network interfaces
# available on the server on 8080 port. It is possible to listen to just one or 
# multiple interfaces using the "rpc.bind" configuration directive, 
# followed by one or more IP addresses and port.
#
# Examples:
#
# Note this directive is only support "golang rpc" protocol
# rpc.bind 192.168.1.100:8080,10.0.0.1:8080
# rpc.bind 127.0.0.1:8080
# rpc.bind :8080
rpc.bind 127.0.0.1:8080

# By default gosnowflake thrift listens for connections from all the network interfaces
# available on the server on 8080 port. It is possible to listen to just one or 
# multiple interfaces using the "rpc.bind" configuration directive, 
# followed by one or more IP addresses and port.
#
# Examples:
#
# Note this directive is only support "thrift" protocol
# thrift.bind 192.168.1.100:8080,10.0.0.1:8080
# thrift.bind 127.0.0.1:8080
# thrift.bind :8080

# This is used by gosnowflake service profiling (pprof).
# By default gosnowflake pprof listens for connections from local interfaces on 6971
# port. It's not safty for listening internet IP addresses.
#
# Examples:
#
# pprof.bind 192.168.1.100:6971,10.0.0.1:6971
# pprof.bind 127.0.0.1:6971
# pprof.bind :6971

# This is used by gosnowflake service get stat info by http.
# By default gosnowflake pprof listens for connections from local interfaces on 6972
# port. It's not safty for listening internet IP addresses.
#
# Examples:
#
# stat.bind 192.168.1.100:6971,10.0.0.1:6971
# stat.bind 127.0.0.1:6971
# stat.bind :6971

# The working directory.
#
# The log will be written inside this directory, with the filename specified
# above using the 'logfile' configuration directive.
#  
# Note that you must specify a directory here, not a file name.
dir ./

# Log4go configuration path
log ./log.xml

################################## ZOOKEEPER ##################################
[zookeeper]
# The zookeeper cluster section. When gosnowflake start, it will register data 
# in the zookeeper cluster and create a ephemeral node. When gosnowflake died, 
# the node will drop by zookeeper cluster. 

# Zookeeper cluster addresses. Mutiple address split by a ",".
# Examples:
#
# addr 192.168.1.100:2181,10.0.0.1:2181
# addr 127.0.0.1:2181
# addr 10.20.216.122:2181

# Zookeeper cluster session idle timeout seconds. Zookeeper will close the 
# connection after a client is idle for N seconds.
# Examples:
#
# timeout 30s
# timeout 15s
timeout 30s

# gosnowflake zookeeper root path.
path /gosnowflake-servers
